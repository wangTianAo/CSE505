BEE Applications:
-----------------
This folder contains several examples where 
Prolog is used to generate the BEE model, 
compile to CNF using BEE, 
solve using PL-CryptoMinisat
and verify the correctness of the solution.

First we recommand you look on two simple examples
located at "1stExamples" folder:

1stExamples/firstExample.pl
---------------------------
In this file you will see an example for 
encoding several constraints on integers
and decoding integers.

The example show to different approaches
of using BEE :
* The direct approach: where your code contains
  a direct calls to BEE and PL-CryptoMinisat.
* The framework approach: where you using 
  BEE auxiliary framework to ease the process
  and display relevant data.

Read the file contant for more details.

1stExamples/secondExample.pl
----------------------------
In this file you will see an example for
using BEE to solve the problem 
Number Partitioning (CSPlib Problem 049).
http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~tw/csplib/prob/prob049/

The file also contains the two approaches
of using BEE.



The next examples takes the framework approach:

--------------------------
KNIGHT COVERINGS PROBLEM.

This example show how to find an optimal solution by
minimizing an integer using BEE framework.

NQueens/nQueens.pl
------------------
Place N Queens on NxN board so that 
no two queens attack each other.
