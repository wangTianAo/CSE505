Installation Instructions:
---------------------------

to compile the sources (will compile both cliquer and plcliquer):

$ make all
$ make install

this will create a build/ folder that contains everything.
you can copy it wherever, or put it in your file_search_path
(see more details in Usage section)

Supported Platforms:
--------------------

This package has been tested and run on 64 bit linux (debian and ubuntu)
with swi-prolog version 7.x.x. The package should be able to run on
earlier swi-prolog versions, though this is considered experimental.

If you have success compiling this package on windows (with mingw, msvc 
or any other way) we would very much like to know about it.

Usage:
------

After installation, the build folder will be created and contain plcliquer.pl 
and pl-cliquer.so. In order to use the pl-cliquer package call 
use_module(plcliquer) and you're good to go.

If you move plcliquer.pl to another directory you need to either move pl-cliquer.so
with it or modify plcliquer.pl's code to include pl-cliquer.so from another location. 

We suggest you have a file_search_path for cliquer set to pl-cliquer's build
directory, and then you can simply call use_module(cliquer(plcliquer)) etc..
an example of how it might be done is included in examples/cfg/dotswiplrc.example
